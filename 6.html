        <b>What is Philosopher ?</b><br><br>
         a person who offers views or theories on profound questions in ethics, metaphysics, logic, and other related fields.<br><br>
         <b>How To Become Philosopher</b><br><br>
         1: GET A HEAD START ON COLLEGE    <br><br>
        If that description of the field grabs your interest, you may find a career in philosophy worth pursuing. And while the first “official” step to becoming a working professional begins with an undergraduate degree as a philosophy major, you can start preparing for your future today.<br><br>
        
        No matter where you are in your trajectory as a young philosopher, you can give yourself a leg up in college by developing the vital skills philosophers and philosophy majors use daily. These skills include:<br><br>
        
        - Critical thinking<br><br>
        - Problem-solving<br><br>
        - Research skills<br><br>
        - Active reading and listening<br><br>
        - Written and oral communication<br><br>
        - Persuasive writing<br><br>
        - Logical reasoning<br><br>
        - Creative thinking<br><br>
        You may also find it helpful to study another language. Many of the most influential philosophers wrote in Latin, classical Greek, German or French. Reading these texts in their original language allows you to tap into nuances that the translations may miss.<br><br>
        
        To develop these skills, you can:<br><br>
        
        Study philosophy books<br><br>
        Watch videos and documentaries<br><br>
        Sign up for a philosophy course or camp<br><br>
        Ask to sit in on sessions at your local college<br><br>
        2: EARN A BACHELOR’S DEGREE    <br><br> 
        As most philosophy-adjacent careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, your next step is to enroll as a philosophy student in a college degree program.<br><br>
        
        While a four-year philosophy degree is the most obvious choice for a future in philosophy, other programs can help you break into the field, including:<br><br>
        
        Classical Studies – As a classical studies major, you’ll explore every aspect of life in ancient Rome and Greece, including the most famous philosophers.<br><br>
        History of Ideas – A history of ideas minor challenges you to think deeply about diverse topics—just like a philosopher.<br><br>
        Religious Studies – Religion and philosophy often go hand-in-hand, so a religious studies degree can be worthwhile.<br><br>
        Ethics – A minor in ethics will offer a condensed version of some of philosophy’s most fundamental debates.<br><br>
        Conflict Resolution – In a conflict resolution program, you’ll hone the debate and reasoning skills on which philosophers rely.<br><br>
        In many cases, you can wrap up your college or university experience with an internship. Internships can bolster your chances of finding a job after graduation.<br><br>
        3: PURSUE AN ADVANCED DEGREE (OPTIONAL)     
        To further increase your chances of landing a secure, well-paying job, you may want to commit further to your academic discipline and continue your education. As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Studies (BLS), professionals with master’s degrees earn 18% more per week than those with bachelor’s degrees, while employees with doctoral degrees take home 43% more.<br><br>
        
        What’s more, some jobs will require an advanced degree, so it’s often worth extending your quest for knowledge by earning a:<br><br>
        
        Master’s degree – Master’s programs typically take two to three years of full-time schooling.<br><br>
        Doctoral degree – Earning a PhD usually takes an additional one to two years of full-time study.<br><br>
        <b>Types of Philoshopher</b><br><br>
 1.	Axiology:<br><br>
Also referred to as the theory of value, Axiology explores the nature of value and its metaphysical aspects. Value Theory is often interchangeably used with Axiology and this branch of Philosophy peruses upon the value of goodness. To put it simply, Axiology looks at the concept of value in terms of its philosophical terms and argues questions about nature and what actually is valued.><br><br>
2.	Metaphysics:<br><br>
Metaphysics has been a primary area of philosophical debate. It is mainly concerned with explaining the nature of being and the world. Traditionally, it has two different study areas, including Cosmology and Ontology. Cosmology is focused on understanding the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe, which includes laws that keep it in perfect order. On the other hand, Ontology investigates various types of things that exist and their relationship with each other. Much before the discovery of modern science, all science-related questions were asked as a part of Metaphysics.<br><br>

3.	Epistemology:<br><br>
Another major component of Philosophy is Epistemology. Going back into history, this term originated from the Greek word episteme which literally means knowledge, and the other half of the word ‘logy means ‘the study of’. Basically, it is about the study of knowledge. (50gram) What can we know? A fundamental question concerning Epistemology is, what is knowledge? It also asks questions like, can knowledge ever be absolute? Is there a limit for humans to know certain things? If we are living in a world of simulation, how can we know it? These are some of the essential questions Epistemology seeks answers for.<br><br>
4.	Ethics: Everyone in their day-to-day life tries to conduct themselves according to some established ethical norms. This philosophical concept has different applications in a person’s real life. For instance, certain organisations have ethical committees that lay down rules of behaviour for their employees. Ethics is concerned with the definition of right and wrong. It elucidates schools of thought that instruct us how to act in a given situation, which has always been a matter of contention between philosophers. Every philosopher has defined it according to their own subjective understanding.<br><br>
5.	Political Philosophy<br><br>
Combining the two fields of Politics and Philosophy, Political Philosophy studies political government, laws, liberty, justice, rights, authority, political states and systems, ethics, and more. It explores the concepts of why we need governments, the role played by governments, and what are its constituents, amongst others.<br><br>
6.	Aesthetics:<br><br>
Every person defines beauty as per his or her own perspectives. This philosophical subject is wholly devoted to defining the different aspects of beauty, even its contours. How do we find something beautiful? Is beauty always subjective or can it be objective too? Can everyone find a thing beautiful? It also examines individual tastes and attempts to provide answers about these things in a scientific manner. Aesthetic Philosophy’s primary topic of investigation is beauty and art. It is often debated inside its classrooms. It also talks about performing arts like music.<br><br>
7.	Logic:<br><br>
We use this word in our commonplace conversations, so we are all aptly familiar with it. People constantly ask each other, “where is the logic behind this or that?”. People even acknowledge a good thought or act by calling it logically correct. Hence, the question arises, what does the Science of logic has to do with Philosophy? In logic, we usually construct two sentences which are called premises, and they are used to make a conclusion. This sort of logic is called syllogism, pioneered by Aristotle.<br><br>
8.	Nature of Philosophy<br><br>
The literal meaning of Philosophy is the ‘love of wisdom’ and it enquires into human reality finding rational conception of our being. The nature of philosophy can be said to be purely scientific as it incorporates curious discovery of human reality and integrates with other sciences like Psychology, Sociology, Physics, and Political Science, amongst others to understand various philosophical questions. Through the 7 branches of Philosophy, i.e. Metaphysics, Axiology, Epistemology, Logic, Ethics, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics, it sets out to harmonize sciences to understand the human mind and the world.<br><br>

        <b>WHAT IS FASHION DESIGNER?</b><br><br>
        Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories.

        <b>Types of Fashion Designer</b><br><br>
        1. Apparel<br><br>
        Apparel designers focus on creating various clothing items for customers. Since there are many types of clothing pieces to create, apparel designers typically pursue specialties within this field. They often create different styles for consumers all over the world, from celebrity dresses to workers' uniforms.<br><br>
        2. Haute couture<br><br>
        These designers typically work for more high-profile and wealthier consumers. They often create customized and one-of-a-kind apparel according to each individual customers' needs and preferences. Haute couture designers usually have a smaller clientele, as they regularly work with the same customers to take their measurements and design clothing pieces for upcoming events according to the clients' specific style and preferences.<br><br>
        3. Ready-to-wear<br><br>
        Also known as pret-a-porter designers, these professionals create apparel for groups of people. These designers create outfits with the correct material, presentation and cut customers request and manufacture their clothes in smaller and more segmented groups. This ensures that the apparel fits the specifications of each customer without being considered a custom-made design.<br><br>
        4. Mass market<br><br>
        These designers create apparel items for a general and broad audience. Each item a mass-market designer creates undergoes a mass-production process and reaches the open market for sale to any customers interested in purchasing them. These clothes rarely have any limited editions or custom fitting options available to customers, as anyone willing to purchase the products can buy and wear them.<br><br>
        5. Footwear<br><br>
        Footwear designers create new shoes, like sneakers, flats or high heels. Many professionals who pursue this field can specialize in certain areas, like athletic or formal footwear. Employees who work in this field typically follow apparel trends to ensure they match well with the shoe designs they create. They may collaborate closely with apparel designers to build complementary designs. Some footwear designers may create custom designs for individual consumers, especially sneaker designers.<br><br>
        6. Accessory<br><br>
        These designers create jewelry, like bracelets, earrings and necklaces or accessory items like scarves, hats, handbags and glasses. Accessory designers are typically responsible for creating captivating and fashionable designs for items that aren't considered apparel or clothing. They typically visit design conventions or other related industry events to meet with manufacturers to purchase individual materials and pieces to build whole accessory designs.<br><br>
        7. Sportwear<br><br>
        Designers within this category typically make fashion pieces for athletic or daily wear. The fabrics they use often contain more comfortable and durable materials that can stretch easily and wick away any moisture or sweat when customers exercise. Both apparel and shoes designers often work within this category of designers. These designers need advanced knowledge of special finishes and performance textiles to create quality, long-lasting and durable designs.<br><br>
        8. Evening wear<br><br>
        Designers for this type of fashion typically focus on more luxurious styles, fabrics and materials. Customers typically wear these designs to elegant events. Because of this, the fabric used to make these pieces is often more expensive than most, so the revenue gained from product sales can be high. Common types of apparel these designers make include evening gowns, suits, tuxedos and wedding dresses.<br><br>
        9. Childrenswear<br><br>
        Childrenswear designers create shoes and apparel for kids of all ages, from infants to teenagers. They usually work with fewer fabrics and materials, since children-sized clothes are often smaller than other clothing items. Most of these items' designs also come with lists of materials, fabrics or other design choices designers can't use. For instance, designers shouldn't include detachable buttons on infants' or toddlers' clothes, as they could be choking hazards.<br><br>
        10. Limited edition<br><br>
        Limited edition designers typically create pieces for customers who prefer more exclusive apparel, shoes or accessories at lower prices than haute couture items. There are many popular brands with mass-produced items that may offer more exclusive product lines or collections with additional customization options for slightly higher prices than the rest of their mass-produced attire.<br><br>
        11. Classic wear<br><br>
        Those who design classic wear pieces usually create timeless designs that rarely go out of style. These designers create most of these items using high-quality fabrics or materials that are incredibly durable and long-lasting. Customers can also usually wear these pieces all year round, rather than only wearing them during certain fashion seasons.<br><br>
        12. Eco-fashion<br><br>
        These designers create apparel that's stylish, trendy and affordable all at once. Many of these pieces are also good for the environment, as most of the items or fabrics come from sourced materials. Designers usually make these items for customers who want to wear socially conscious and environmentally sound attire at a reasonable and affordable cost.<br><br>

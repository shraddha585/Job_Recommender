        <b>What is Dancer?</b><br><br>
        Dancer is a person who Dances, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself<br><br>
       <b>Types of Dancer? </b><br><br>
       •	Classical: This form reached its peak in 19th-century France and Russia. It is often story-driven and orchestrated ("The Nutcracker" is a great example), with fantastical sets and costumes. The movement emphasizes pointe work (dancing on toes), graceful expressions, and symmetry among dancers<br><br>
       •	Neoclassical: This is an evolution of classical ballet, which emerged in the early-to-mid 20th century. Movements are faster and more urgent, with less emphasis on symmetry, and simple sets and costumes. The plot is often nonexistent. Orchestras, bands, or soloists may accompany the dancers.<br><br>
       •	Contemporary: Like neoclassical, the plot is cast aside in favor of pure movement and physical expression, which may not appear to be dancelike at all. Costumes and set designs are frequently simple or abstract. Music or sound work, if used, is often contemporary or experimental in nature.<br><br>
       •	JAZZ: Jazz is a lively dance style that relies heavily on originality and improvisation. This style often uses bold, dramatic body movements, including body isolations and contractions
       •	Tap-Dance: Tap dancers use their feet like drums to create rhythmic patterns and timely beats. Music is rarely used.
       •	Hip-Hop:  Breakdancing—with its popping, locking, and athletic floor movements—is perhaps the earliest form of hip-hop dance. Often, "crews" of teams of dancers would hold competitions to see which group had bragging rights as the best.<br><br>
       •	Belly Dance: Belly dancing emerged from the folk traditions of the Middle East, but its precise origins are unclear. Unlike most forms of Western dancing, which emphasize complex footwork and partner choreography, belly dancing is a solo performance that focuses on the torso and hips.<br><br>
       •	Flaminco: Flamenco consists of three elements: cante (the song), baile (the dance), and guitarra (guitar playing). Each has its own traditions, but the dancing is most often closely associated with flamenco, with its flamboyant gestures and rhythmic foot stamping that calls to mind tap dancing.<br><br>
       <b>How to become a dancer?</b><br><br>
       1. Receive extensive training<br><br>
       You don't need any qualifications or a degree to become a professional dancer, but training is an important factor. Professional dancers begin their training at the age of five and start auditioning for permanent work at 18. The training helps with the development of muscle strength and techniques needed to turn talent into a profession<br><br>
       2. Consider getting a bachelor's degree<br><br>
       It isn't mandatory to have a degree to become a professional dancer, but majoring in dance can give you exposure to different dance genres. You also have the option of concentrating on a specific dance. A variety of universities and colleges offer majors in dance through the fine arts or theater departments. In a dance major, you learn about:<br><br>
       •	Choreography: You learn performance skills through various dancing techniques and ways of expressing yourself through choreography.<br><br>
       •	Production: As a student, you learn about the processes of backstage production. This can include sound operation, how to run a light board, costumes, lighting design and stage management.<br><br>
       •	Dance history: You learn about the origins of dance and how people from different continents view dance from a social, ceremonial and cultural perspective.<br><br>
       •	Teaching: You learn how to develop teaching skills to teach classes to people from different age groups and communities.<br><br>
       •	Movement and body alignment: You learn about muscle coordination and body posture.<br><br>
       3. Gain experience<br><br>
       If you want to increase your chances of getting hired as a professional dancer, you should consider relocating to a city where entertainment thrives.<br><br>
       Taking classes: Participating in dance classes helps you build your craft, stay physically healthy and gain more experience.<br><br>
       Attending workshops: The majority of dance workshops are conducted by established choreographers and members of dance companies.<br><br>

        How to become a professor<br><br>
        You might find the following steps helpful for becoming a college professor:<br><br>
        
        1. Decide your specialisation and earn a bachelor's degree<br><br>
        Decide early on if you want to become a professor in the arts, commerce or science stream and pass your 12th Higher Secondary Certification exam with at least 80-90% aggregate marks. This may help you enrol in a bachelor's degree programme of your choice. It is essential to maintain a high academic record and complete your graduation well above the minimum requirement of 50-55% aggregate marks.<br><br>

        2. Pursue a master's degree<br><br>
        Take the GATE exam, enrol in a master's degree programme of your choice and complete it with more than the minimum requirement of 50-55% aggregate marks. By clearing the master's degree programme with a good score, you may be eligible to work as a lecturer or a demonstrator. The work experience is likely to help you advance in your career.<br><br>
        
        3. Pass competitive exams<br><br>
        After getting a master's degree, you can appear for and pass the NET, the SET or the CSIR NET competitive exams. The NET makes you eligible for assistant professor jobs in every college and university throughout the country, but the SET only gives you eligibility for assistant professor jobs within the state you cleared the exam. By taking the CSIR NET, you may be selected for a lecturer position or get a junior research fellowship.<br><br>

        4. Obtain a doctoral degree<br><br>
        Next, you can enrol in a doctoral degree programme. Having a doctoral degree can exempt you from appearing for the competitive exams, and you can directly apply for a college professor position.<br><br>
